# Flow State

Part of [Cognitive Ergonomics](ergonomics.md#cognitive-ergonomics).

Flow is a mental state of complete focus and immersion.
People in flow state are 500% more productive (10-year study).

## The Cost of Interruptions

- **23 minutes** to fully refocus after an interruption (UC Irvine)
- **10-15 minutes** for a programmer to resume editing after interruption (Georgia Tech)
- Self-interruptions (voluntary task switching) are more disruptive than external ones

## Conditions for Flow

1. Clear goal in working memory
2. Challenge-skill balance (not too easy, not too hard)
3. **15-20 minutes** of uninterrupted focus to enter

## Tool Implications

- Start instantly (shell ≤200ms, no waiting = no context switch)
- Provide immediate feedback
- Batch operations over repetitive manual steps
