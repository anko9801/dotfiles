# Ergonomics (Human Factors)

Single principle: Reduce human burden.

## Academic Foundation

IEA (International Ergonomics Association) defines three domains:

| Domain | Focus | This Repo |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Physical Ergonomics | Body, posture, RSI | [keybinding-design.md](keybinding-design.md) |
| Cognitive Ergonomics | Mental workload, decision-making | See below |
| Organizational Ergonomics | Teams, processes | (Out of scope) |

## Cognitive Ergonomics

The average person holds roughly 4 chunks in working memory.
All cognitive principles below reduce this burden:

| Principle | Document | How It Reduces Load |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| Security | (in [tool-selection.md](tool-selection.md)) | Peace of mind eliminates worry |
| Flow State | [flow-state.md](flow-state.md) | Avoids 23-min recovery cost |
| POSIX Compatibility | [posix-compatibility.md](posix-compatibility.md) | LLM assistance reduces research |
| Declarative | [declarative.md](declarative.md) | Externalizes procedural memory |
| Unix Philosophy | [unix-philosophy.md](unix-philosophy.md) | Fewer concepts to learn |

```
